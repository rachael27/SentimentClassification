# Quick Start with Rstudio

| **OPTIONAL:** If you’ve worked with Rstudio before. |
| :--- |


Let’s have a quick look at the Rstudio IDE. It will help you to navigate the IDE faster.

**To remember**

* Each piece of code in R is saved with a **.R extension** and is called a **SCRIPT.**

* Comments in a R script start with the **“\#” symbol.**

* The prompt in the console starts with the **“&gt;” symbol.**

* Each package that you need for a script should first be installed and then loaded using the **library** command.

* Installation of packages are done only once, however **loading of packages are done for every session.**

* IF YOUR SESSION RESTARTS, LOAD ALL YOUR PACKAGES ONCE AGAIN!! \(using the **library\(NameOfPkg\) **command\)

* **Code Editor-** The place to write your scripts and for viewing data structures using the View command. It contains buttons for running the entire script or for running it line-by-line.

* **R Console-** You will use it view the output and for executing single-line commands.

* **Workspace and History-** You will find each variable that you created under the “Workspace” tab and a history of all your commands under the “History” tab.

* **Plots and Files- **Your one stop for viewing files/plots/installing packages etc.

| FUN: Type “Hello &lt;&lt;Your Name&gt;&gt;” in the RConsole. \(Don’t forget the quotes\).When the greetings are over, proceed to the next section. |
